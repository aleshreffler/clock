# clock
An DML (Document Makeup Library)-based clock that shows the real-time with wedges of color to help visually prompt time management with "wedges" of color for designated time frames. DML is an object-oriented web programming framework based on Javascript and HTML (similar, but simpler than VUE and REACT). A wonderful solution for child-like brains. This real-time clock runs locally in your browser and requires no installation, unlike many similar clock applications on the market.

Step 1. Download the clock.html file.

Step 2. Right click and open with browser to view clock. 

Step 3. Be amazed and overwhelmed by its greatness. 


To customize the clock, open with text editor or IDE. Colors of drawn elements are in HEX format. Hopefully the comments are intuitive enough to get the gist of changing the wedges. Notice that you can't structure a full wedge over the 12:00 time, you have to split it in order to get it to work properly. 


INSPIRATION:

In a desparate effort to find a desktop app that gives an option for the wedge customization, none were to be found. My goal was to create a visual aid to help stay on task and wrap-up at the end of the work day. In the course of a few hours, I found a solution worth sharing.
