# clock
An DML (html-based) clock that shows wedges of color to help visually prompt time management with "wedges" of color for designated time frames. A wonderful solution for child-like brains.

Step 1. Download the clock.html file.

Step 2. Right click and open with browser to view clock. 

Step 3. Be amazed and overwhelmed by its greatness. 


To customize the clock, open with text editor or IDE. Colors of drawn elements are in HEX format. Hopefully the comments are intuitive enough to get the gist of changing the wedges. Notice that you can't structure a full wedge over the 12:00 time, you have to split it in order to get it to work properly.
